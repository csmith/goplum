The SNMP plugin provides checks that query SNMP.

== Checks

=== snmp.int

[source,goplum]
----
check snmp.int "example" {
  agent = "192.168.1.1"
  port = 161
  community = "public"
  oid = [".1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.4.11.0", ".1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.4.4"]
  at_least = 10000
  at_most = 90000
}
----

Queries one or more SNMP OIDs, and checks that the (integer) value is in the given range.

Port and community are optional, defaulting to `161` and `public`.

Only one of `at_least` and `at_most` needs to be specified, but both can be.

=== snmp.string

[source,goplum]
----
check snmp.string "example" {
  agent = "192.168.1.1"
  port = 161
  community = "public"
  oid = ".1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.9.1.2"
  content = "HDD"
  content_expected = true
}
----

Queries one or more SNMP OIDs, and checks that the (string) value contains
(or doesn't contain) the given content.

Port and community are optional, defaulting to `161` and `public`.

Content_expected is optional and defaults to `true`, if set to `false` then
the check will fail if the given content *is* found in the returned value.
