:toc: macro

The network plugin provides checks for low-level network services.

== Checks

=== network.connect

[source,goplum]
----
check network.connect "example" {
  address = "hostname:1234"
  network = "tcp6"
}
----

Attempts to open a network connection to the given address. Addresses must be in
the form "host:port", "host%zone:port", "[host]:port" or "[host%zone]:port".

By default, connection attempts will be made over TCP (IPv6 or IPv4 using Fast Fallback).
If the `network` parameter is included then connection attempts will be limited to that
network. Valid options are: "tcp", "tcp4", "tcp6", "udp", "udp4", "udp6".
