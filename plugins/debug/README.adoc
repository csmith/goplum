= Debug plugin
:toc: macro

The debug plugin provides checks and alerts for use when developing or testing Goplum.
These probably aren't of interest to you if you just want to run Goplum.

== Checks

=== debug.random

[source,goplum]
----
check debug.random "example" {
  percent_good = 0.8
}
----

Passes or fails at random. If the `percent_good` parameter is specified then checks will pass with
that probability (i.e. a value of 0.8 means a check has an 80% chance to pass).

== Alerts

=== debug.sysout

[source,goplum]
----
alert debug.sysout "example" {}
----

Prints alerts to system out, prefixed with 'DEBUG ALERT'.
