= Exec plugin
:toc: macro

The exec plugin allows you to execute commands.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The exec plugin should be used as a last resort. Using (or writing) a Goplum plugin
provides much more control around how the check runs, allows for standardised
configuration, avoids the need for external dependencies, and so on.
