= plumctl

`plumctl` is a command-line tool to remote control a GoPlum instance using the
link:api.adoc[GoPlum API].

== Getting started

To install the latest version:

[source]
-----
$ go install github.com/csmith/goplum/cmd/plumctl
-----

Then to create a configuration file:

[source]
-----
$ plumctl init plum.example.com:7586
Config created in /home/user/.config/plumctl.
You must provide your CA certificate, client certificate and client private key:

    CA cert: /home/user/.config/plumctl/ca.crt
Client cert: /home/user/.config/plumctl/client.crt
 Client key: /home/user/.config/plumctl/client.key

You can adjust these paths in the configuration file.
-----

As described, you must provide the certificate from your Certificate Authority
and a cert and key pair for plumctl to use when connecting to the API. For more
information on how to generate these see the link:api.adoc[API documentation].

== Commands

=== plumctl init <server:port>

Creates a new configuration file pointing at the given API endpoint. GoPlum
automatically determines an appropriate configuration file location and will
output it.

=== plumctl checks

Lists all checks configured in GoPlum.

Checks that are suspended, not passing, or haven't yet settled are marked
as such in the output.

=== plumctl results

Streams check results as they happen. Each line will show the result of
one check that was executed.

=== plumctl suspend <check>

Suspends the check with the specified name. The check won't execute again
until it is unsuspended.

=== plumctl unsuspend <check>

Unsuspends a previously suspended check. The check will be queued for
execution as normal.
